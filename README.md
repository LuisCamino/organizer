# ORGANIZER
## Why i made this?
I decide to create this application for three main reasons. 
#### - it once this idea came to my mind and i decided to create it. 
#### - I have never seen an application like this.
#### - I think its cool app and useful for people like me who have a messy desktop 
## Important pre-requisite:
You will need python installed on your OS
## Instructions
Organizer is a way to clean up your files, no matter where you execute it, it will organize the directory where its executed.
<br>
Eg: put the file_organizer.py on your Desktop to clean it or just use it inside a directory to clean all the files from that directory
<br><br>
*Note: if some files didnt move, try to execute again the organizer, sometimes it have some troubles to move certain files*
